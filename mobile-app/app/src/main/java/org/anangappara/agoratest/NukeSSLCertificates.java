/**
 * This class provides a mechanism to bypass SSL certificate validation in Android applications.
 *
 * This is particularly useful in development or testing environments where self-signed certificates
 * are used and are not inherently trusted by the Android system. By disabling SSL validation, it allows
 * HTTPS requests to proceed even when certificates are invalid or untrusted.
 *
 * WARNING: This code should only be used in DEVELOPMENT or TEST environments.
 * Never use this code in PRODUCTION as it introduces serious security vulnerabilities.
 *
 * Purpose of this code:
 * 1. **Workaround for Self-Signed Certificates:**
 *    - Self-signed certificates that arenâ€™t trusted by the Android CA store will cause HTTPS requests to fail.
 *    - This code suppresses SSL checks to let requests go through.
 *
 * 2. **Development and Testing:**
 *    - Useful for working with local servers or staging environments using non-standard certificates.
 *
 * 3. **SSL Validation Disabling:**
 *    - Bypasses both server and client certificate validation and disables hostname verification.
